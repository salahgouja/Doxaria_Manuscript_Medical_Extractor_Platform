# 🧠 Doxaria – AI-Powered Medical Document Understanding Platform

## 📘 Overview

**What happens when AI meets medical insurance?**

**Doxaria** is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how insurance providers understand and validate medical documents—ranging from handwritten prescriptions to complex reimbursement forms. 
Developed as a final-year capstone project at **Esprit School of Engineering**, Doxaria integrates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with real-world insurance workflows to deliver a robust, scalable, and intelligent solution.

> "It wasn’t just about applying machine learning—it was about creating real value."

## 🧩 System Architecture – 3 Smart Modules

### ✅ Module 1: Medical Document OCR
- **Layout Detection** using YOLOv8.
- **Text Recognition** (printed and handwritten) via CRNN and PyTesseract.
- Handles multilingual and noisy medical scans.

### ✅ Module 2: Patient-Centric Automation
- Validates documents and extracts key data automatically.
- Speeds up processing and reimbursement times.
- Improves communication and satisfaction between providers and patients.

### ✅ Module 3: Intelligent Error Detection
- Detects missing fields, inconsistencies, and anomalies in claims.
- Enhances accuracy and compliance with insurance protocols.
